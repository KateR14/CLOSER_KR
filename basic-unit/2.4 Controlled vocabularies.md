- How do we find controlled vocabularies?

## Metadata management and best practice

In order to make sure metadata is effective for both humans and computers, we need to manage our metadata.

If we don't follow metadata best practice, the value and effectiveness of our metadata is diminished.

For example, why is this metadata not helpful?

_[screenshot of bad metadata / duplication -- filters on shopping website -- find on shared drive]_

## Impact of low quality metadata

- Inconsistent and duplicated metadata:
  - Hinders the searchability and discoverability of data
  - Undermines the reliability and validity of data
  - Is time consuming as people have to identify what terms are relevant for their search and integrate different terms

If metadata is bad quality, it undermines its three mains purposes to increase discovery, understanding and resusability of data.

---
## Best practice in metadata 

To ensure metadata is effective, best practice in metadata creation needs to be followed.

These best practices should promote:
- Consistency so metadata reliably describes data and can be compared across datasets
- Accuracte description so data is easily understood
- Searchability of metadata so data is discoverable
- Persistent use of terms that don't expire

---
## Tools for metadata best practice

Two main tools that are used implement metadata best practice are:

1. Controlled vocabularies
  - Taxonomies
  - Ontologies
    
2. Metadata standards

In this unit, we will look at controlled vocabularies and the related concepts of taxonomies and ontologies.
In the next unit, we will look at metadata standards.

## What are controlled vocabularies?

'A controlled vocabulary is a list of terms that describes a certain domain of knowledge. In the controlled vocabulary you **only use one term to describe one particular phenomenon**, excluding all other synonyms.'*

Controlled vocabularies provide consistency and structure to metadata, reducing the risk of duplicate terms where different terms are used for the same concept or one term is used for multiple concepts.

Controlled vocabularies are used in descriptive metadata fields to support consistent, accurate, and quick indexing and retrieval of digital asset content. It has a specific definition associated with a particular value**.

## Using a controlled vocabulary 

There are different controlled vocabularies for different concepts.

In this example, ...

_[Give example of using a controlled vocabulary]_

---

## Finding a controlled vocabulary

You can find relevant controlled vocabularies for your research online.
Websites such as [Bartoc](https://bartoc.org/) compiles many controlled vocabularies allowing you to search and filter to identify the one most appropriate for your research.

If you storing your data in a repository or using a metadata standard, they may specify certain controlled vocabularies to use.

---

## Case study (practice): Finding a controlled vocabulary

Using [Bartoc](https://bartoc.org/), find a controlled vocabulary that is relevant for this data:

_[Description of research project - discipline, area of enquiry]_

---

## Case study (answer): Finding a controlled vocabulary

This is the controlled vocabulary we chose.

Here are the reasons behind this choice:
- [give the thought process behind choosing that particular controlled vocabulary]

---

## Application: Find a controlled vocabulary for your research

Now you have practised finding a relevant controlled vocabulary, find a controlled vocabulary for your research.

---

## Case study (practice): Using a controlled vocabularly 

_[Give small dataset and ask participants to apply controlled vocabulary terms]_

---

## Case study (answer): Using a controlled vocabularly 

_[Answers to above]_

## Application: Using a controlled vocabularly

## Controlled vocabularies: going further

Some controlled vocabularies not only define concept terms but also specify the relationship between different concepts.


[How taxonomies and onotlogies relate to controlled vocabularies]

---

## Taxonomies

- A type of controlled vocabularies, taxonomies specify hierarchical structures between terms
_- Give an example of taxonomies_

[Overview of taxonomies - high level explanation]

---

## Ontologies

- Ontology further specifies the relationships between different terms
- _Give an example of ontology_

[Overview of ontologies - high level explanation]

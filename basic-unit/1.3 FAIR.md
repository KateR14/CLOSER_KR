---

## Outline [#trainer]

## FAIR data principles

An important principle to underpin any data management approach is the FAIR data principles.

---

## What is FAIR?

You might have hear about FAIR before or this might be the first time you're coming across the principles. 

Here is a short video to give an overview of what FAIR data is in research.

## What is FAIR? [#Overview]

- **F**indable
- **A**ccessible
- **I**nteroperable
- **R**e-usable

What can we do as researchers to enact these principles?

## **F**indable

**Findable**: other researchers can easily find your data manually and by machine.

- What you can do:
  - Link your publications/data 
    - [How to Cite Datasets and Link to Publications DDC Guide](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/cite-datasets)
  - Create a DOI for your data
  - Cite the data that you have used using a DOI
  - Create a Persistent Idenditifier (PID) for yourself
  - Deposit your data in an trusted repository/archive
     - Find an appropriate archive e.g. UKDS or your university
     - [Where to keep research data - DDC guide](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/where-keep-research-data)
  - **Create rich machine-readable metadata**

## **F**indable practice tasks

- **Findable** task 1: Using this tool, find the trusted repository or archive that is best suited for your data

- **Findable** task 2: Using OrchidID create a free PID 
    - DOI: you can create a DOI with DataCite Scheme

## **A**ccessible

**Accessible**: other researchers can clearly understand how to access your data. Note, this does not mean data has to be 'open'. Even when data is restricted, rich metadata should be available in order for external researchers to know what your data is descibing and what data sharing policies are in place. FAIR states data should be _'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'._

- What you can do:
  - Use standardised technology and readily available software for your data
    - The best format on for your data depends on the type of data you have collected
  - Provide your data to repositories in their preferred format, this can be found on their webpages
  - **Create rich machine-readable metadata**

---

## **A**ccessible practice tasks

**Accessible task 1**: Using [this guide from UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/format-your-data/recommended-formats/), detemine which is the best file format for your data

---

## **I**nteroperable

**Interoperable**: data should be easily integrated and combined with other datasets.

  - What you can do:
      - **Create rich metadata** that complies with relevant metadata standards and schemas 
      - Use existing vocabularies, classifications, ontologies etc. when possible  
        - e.g. Controlled Vocabularies for mode of collection [11]
        - e.g. Survey responses Office for National statistics ethnic group classification [12]

---

## **Interoperable** practice tasks

- **Interoperable** task 1: use [BARTOC's controlled vocabularies search tool](https://bartoc.org/) to find the vocabularies most relevant to your data

- **Interoperable** task 2:

## **R**e-usable

**Re-usable**: data should be available for future research, study and processing, for example secondary research and cross-study research

- **Create rich metadata** to provide context 
- Use standardised terms
- Select a clear data usage and sharing license
  
---

## **R**e-usable practice tasks

- **Reusable** task 1: use [Creative Commons Guidance](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/) and their [License chooser tool](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/) to find data sharing license best suited for your research
-

## Benefits of FAIR for your data

- Maximises the value and usefulness of your data
- Ensures long-term preservation and reusability of your data
- Enables cross-study and secondary research
- Speeds up the progress of research and improves efficiency
  
---

## The importance of FAIR important for research

- Helps demonstrate the impact of research when people re-use and cite your dataset, so you get credit for all your outputs
- Easier for others to find your data and increases your visibility
- Scientific journals and funders now require scientists to share data
- Improves the quality of your data and accuracy of your research results
- Provides proof of transparent and valid conduct
- Improves our confidence in data and research

## FAIR Data Assessment List

Using the FAIR Data Assessment list 

- (F) Does you dataset have a persistent identified e.g. a PID or DOI?
- (F) Is your data in a trusted repository?
- (A+R) Does your data have an assigned license and data sharing policy? (please note, your data does not need to be open to be FAIR)
- (F+A) Does your dataset have a README file?
  - Does your README file explain how one could access the data?
  - Does your README file explain the necessary software required to access the file?
- (F+A+I+R) Does your data have metadata that adheres to relevant schemas and standards?

## What was the recurring element that helped implement FAIR Principles?

---

## What was the recurring element that helped implement FAIR Principles?

Metadata!
- Documenting your data through creating rich metadata is one of the most effective ways of implementing FAIR principles in your research
  
- In the next module we will delve into exploring metadata including:
  - What is metadata?
  - How to identify what metadata is most important to create 
  - How and when to create metadata
  - Best practice in creating and using metadata

---

## Summary

- **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, **R**e-usable
- Aims to optimise and make reuse of data easier
- Metadata is key to FAIR
- Metadata should ideally be documented from the start and updated throughout to feed into FAIR processes
- Infrastructures are best placed to implement FAIR for the benefit of users
- Data producers and users need to contribute to create FAIR data

## A mystery can drink ...

Imagine it's a hot day and you're very thirsty. You come across this sealed can on the side of a road ...

<img src="img/plain-can.png" alt="Alt Text" width="610" height="590">

Do you know what's inside the can? Would you want to drink it?

---

## A mystery can drink ...

Because the can doesn't have a label we don't know ...
- What's inside 
- Where it's come from
- When it was made or by who

It's unlikely that anyone will want to drink from that can and if they do, it's a risk!

---

## A mystery can drink ... explained

Alternatively, if you came across this can in a local supermarket, would you know what is inside it? Would you be happy to drink it?

## A mystery can drink ... explained

Most people would be more confident about what is inside the can as the packaging contains:

- The brand
- Description of the drink/flavour
- Ingredient list
- Nutrition
- Location of production

Additionally, if the drink was stocked in shop you knew and trusted, you would be more likely to want to drink it than if you found it on the side of the road. The drink would also be stocked alongside other similar soda drinks so you could read the labels, compare drinks and make an informed decision about the drink you pick.

---
## How does the can relate to metadata ...

Imagine the liquid inside the can is a dataset. 

The information about the drink (the brand, location of production, ingredient list, nutrition etc.) is the metadata which tells us what the dataset is. 

Like the plain can, without any metadata, we cannot know what the dataset consists of or the contextual information like who conducted the research and when.

Let's consider this in a research context ...

## Understanding a dataset

If you were presented with this dataset, what would you need to know in order to understand and use the data?

- Let’s have a look at more of a contextualised example of how metadata can help us to understand and use data.
- On the slide is a screenshot of a dataset. 
- With the people on your table, please take a couple of minutes to discuss what information you would need in order to be able to understand and use this data.

*Study: [National Child Development Study](https://closer.ac.uk/cross-study-data-guides/cognitive-measures-guide/ncds-cognition/ncds-age-7-copying-designs-test/)
Sweep: [Age 7 Survey (1965)](https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.cls.ncds/0103e4b4-09a6-41a8-997b-3ca0b1edcafc)

## Some questions that might be asked to understand and use data

![](img/Understanding-data-bubbles.png "Alt text here")

Through answering these questions, we start to create the metadata for this data.

Metadata gives us additional context about the data helping us to understand and interpret the data as well as assess how relevant the data for us.

As a starting point, metadata can be considered as the who/what/where/when/why/how of the data. 
- Who collected the data? 
- What data did they collect? 
- When was it collected? 
- Where was it collected? 
- Why was it collected? 
- And how was it collected?

---

## Why is it important that we have this metadata?

Without this data, we wouldn't be able to understand the dataset. 

Capturing this metadata means the data is more discoverable and available for re-use.

Therefore, metadata is essential so other researchers can understand your data. It is also a useful tool for yourself so you can understand 

::: notes


- This example shows us how metadata is necessary to understand someone else’s data, but it’s also good to consider how this information might be useful for your future self when working on your own data, so you don’t end up in a Sam1 situation!
- Capturing this information (or metadata) means that the data is available for re-use, and it also makes it machine-actionable to make data management easier and more efficient, and the data more discoverable.

## Dataset with metadata

Here is the dataset again with the relevant metadata.

## Defining metadata

- Metadata is a form of data documentation 
- People often descirbe metadata as “data about data” [2]
- Wikipedia “data that provides information about other data, but not the content of the data itself” [3]
- Provides a framework to describe and understand data, so that it can be used in an intelligent and meaningful way

::: notes

If you’ve heard of metadata before, you’ll have likely heard the definition “data about data”.
Wikipedia has a slightly different take… (e.g. the date and time of a text message is metadata, but the text of that message is not)

(3) https://www.britannica.com/technology/metadata

## Defining metadata as a subset of data documentation

However, what makes metadata different from other forms of data documentation?

Consider these two descriptions of a dataset. 

[textual description of metadata] // [structured metadata]

Both contain the same information. However, if I was researcher looking for data in this field, which format would be more helpful for me?

Why?

---

## Defining metadata

  - Metadata is structured documentation that is **machine-readable**
  - For metadata to be machine readable, it must be structured according to a specific set of rules
    
  - By being structured and machine-readable, metadata:
    - Standardises the content and structure of documentation, making it easier for computers to extract information from the metadata
    - Tells a computer what something is, how it relates to other things (“objects”), and what to do with it
    - Makes data management and data discovery easier and more efficient
    - Allows researchers to discover, understand and access data
    - Helps your future self to understand your past research, preserving your data for continued use

::: notes

*Note*: A schema is a formal technique for organizing metadata

## What is metadata in a research context?

If you would like further explanation as to what metadata is, what [this knowledge clip from UGent University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW2T_cnqKPU) to gain an overview of metadata in a research context.

---

## Purpose of metadata

- Metadata supports three main uses:
  - Understandability and context - it helps to convey the meaning of resources
  - Use and action - it describes the limits of reasonable use or what actions can be taken
  - Discovery - it helps people to find relevant resources

::: notes

:::

---

## Why is metadata important?

- Metadata is the core component of Research Data Management (RDM) and should be included in all Data Management Plans (DMPs)
  
- Metadata may also be required by other organisations such as ...
  - Institutes (in your working contract or project agreements)
  - Funding agencies (ensure reusability and meet FAIR requirements)
  - Journals (as a condition for publishing)
  - Supervisors (data citation to enhance researcher reputation)
  - Projects (collaboration across agencies/organisations)

## Metadata and FAIR

Thinking back to FAIR data principles, consider how metadata underpins each principle:

- Findable
- Accessible
- Interoperable
- Reusable

Test your confidence with FAIR and metadata awareness with Data Archiving and Networked Services [Fair Aware tool](https://fairaware.dans.knaw.nl/)

---

## Benefits of metadata for you

- Preserves your data and research
- Helps your future self understand and reuse the data
- Helps others find, understand, compare, and use your data
- More accurate, higher-quality research results
- Implements FAIR data principles
- Open science - proof of transparent and valid conduct

::: notes

As well as external factors, metadata is helpful for your future self, to help you understand your data later down the line, and be able to share it in a meaningful way with others.

:::

---

## Summary

- Metadata is information that describes data
- Metadata is based on a structure that can be processed by a computer 
- Metadata is important for your future self and others to discover, understand and use data
- Metadata allows researchers to use data effectively because it includes the important information needed to exploit the full potential of data

## Intended learning outcome

- Overview of research data management 
- Reasons and benefits for data management
- How to implement good data management
---

## Outline [#trainer]
- What is data management and why is it important? (Discussion and definition)
- What is the impact of bad data management?
- What are benefits of good data management and why is it important

---

## What is data management? [#Discussion]

- Now we have covered what research data is, we can look into what we do with it and how.
- What do we mean by data management?

::: notes
Trainer: give 5-10 minutes for people to discuss what data management is before revealing the definition. Invite people to share their ideas with the group.

## Data management definition [#overview]

  - "Research data management (RDM) is about handling research data effectively and appropriately throughout the life of a research project and beyond. Research data management refers to all aspects of creating, storing, sharing and archiving data and is an essential aspect of conducting responsible research" -- MANTRA

## Bad data management 

What happens if you don't manage your data well ...

[Sam1 Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2zK3sAtr-4)

---

## Bad data management (Discussion)

- Reflecting on the video you've just watched as well as your own experience, what are some examples of bad data management?

---

## Examples of bad data management

- Data is not properly cited or linked in publications
- Links to research are broken 
- There is limited information about the data
- Data in unusable or proprietary software
- No information about the data sharing policy or
- Unclear data access process, how long it takes, cost etc.
- Limited context to understand the data

---

## What is the impact of bad data management?

- Again, refelcting on the video and your own experience, what are the impacts of bad data management on research?

---

## What is the impact of bad data management?

- Research data is in a silo
  - Data cannot be re-used by other researchers or by yourself in future studies
  - Research could be unnecessarily duplicated
  - Prevents secondary research or cross-study research from happening
    
- Data gets lost and is less secure
  - If there is no clear data usage or sharing policies data could be misused
  - If data are not stored in a secure location, they could be lost or accessed by people without permission
    
- Time wasted trying to understand data or organise data retrospectively
  - Researchers have to spend longer trying to find data, understand it and organise it into a meaningful structure
    
- Could jeopardise future research funding
  - If your data is inaccessible and poor quality, institutions are less likely to give funding for future research

*Bad data management causes inefficiency and devalues the quality and usability of your research.*

---

## How to implement good data management 

- Develop a robust Data Management Plan (DMP) at the begining of your research project
  - DMPs should address the whole data lifecycle, covering how data will be collected, processed, analysed, described, preserved, and shared during the course of a research project and beyond
  - DMPs should be a living document that is updated as new processes are created and refined 
- Implement FAIR data principles 
- Create high quality metadata that adheres to relevant standards

## Benefits of good data management

Good data management improves ...

- Efficiency
  - Saves time and resources by establishing robust documentation, stoarge and preservation processes
  - Reduces the risk of losing data and enhances lifespan of data
  - Reduces the potential for research duplication
  - Improves communication and workflows within a project

- Quality and value of your data
  - Enables other researchers to use your research and encourages cross-study research
  - Proof of transparent & valid data
  - Required to obtain funding and/or meet funding bodies' requirements
  - Improves accuracy and security of your data
  - Facilitates re-use of own data

## Good data management case study

_- E.g. show a study which has good data documentation / management with a strong DMP
-  Pick a study whose findings have had an impact on policy/industry as well as been the subject of secondary research and/or cross study research_

---

## Application: How strong is your data management? [#Worksheet]

- Can you answer the following questions about your research?

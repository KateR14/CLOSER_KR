## Intended learning outcomes

[strucutre of this unit needs further consideration]

- How metadata supports the data lifecycle
- How metadata creation and management needs to be considered in all stages of data lifecycle
- How metadata enables each activity in the stage of data lifecycle
---

## Overview


--

## What are the 6 steps in the data lifecycle?

_[Task: step 1: ask participants to name 6 stages of data lifecycle.
       step 2: ask participants to place 6 stages in order (don't specify shape)]_

---

## Which stage includes metadata?

- All of them! Metadata should be integrated in all areas of the data lifecycle.

---

## Metadata helps build provenance in the data lifecycle

- Provenance [define]
- Outline how metadata enables the creation of provenance

---

## Plan

[Metadata creator: Detail what you need to think about when creating metadata at this stage]
[Metadata user: Outline how using metadata assists researchers in this stage]

**Metadata user**
- Helps you find data when conducting a literature research in the planning stage
  - Challenges: data is hard to find if it is in spearate 

 **Metadata creator **
- Metadata at the planning stage:
  - Identify the data repositories/archives we want to deposit our data in. Some infrastructures may have metadata requirements, it is important to identify these at the start of your
  - What controlled vocabularies and metadata standards should we use

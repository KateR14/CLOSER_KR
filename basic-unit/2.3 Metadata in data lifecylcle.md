## Intended learning outcomes

[strucutre of this unit needs further consideration]

- How metadata supports the data lifecycle
- How metadata creation and management needs to be considered in all stages of data lifecycle
- How metadata enables each activity in the stage of data lifecycle

## Overview


--

## What are the 6 steps in the data lifecycle?

[Task: step 1: ask participants to name 6 stages of data lifecycle.
       step 2: ask participants to place 6 stages in order (don't specify shape)]

---

## Metadata and the data lifecycle

Outline why metadata important throught the data lifecycle?

## Plan

[Metadata creator: Detail what you need to think about when creating metadata at this stage]
[Metadata user: Outline how using metadata assists researchers in this stage]

User
- Helps you find data when conducing a literature research in the planning stage
  - Challenges: data is hard to find

 Creator
- Metadata at the planning stage:
  - Identify the data repositories/archives we want to deposit our data in. Some infrastructures may have metadata requirements, it is important to identify these at the start of your
  - What controlled vocabularies and metadata standards should we use

author: Sarah White, Kate Reed
date: March 20, 2025
---

## Intended Learning Outcome
- Understand the characteristics of data
- Understand the purpose of data in research

---

## Outline [#trainer]
- What is data?
- Definition of data
- Data in research
- Introduction to example cast study

---

## What is data?
We use the term data all the time, but what do we actually mean?

---
## Data is everywhere ...

We consume data all the time. Take your weather app for example.
What data is available when we check the weather?

## What makes these data?

- Data can be represented as:
  
  - Numbers e.g. 16*
  - Text e.g. 'Sunny conditions will continue all day.'
  - Symbols e.g. ☀️

Data can come in lots of different formats but what are the characteristics of data that differentiates from them being *just* numbers, words and symbols?

::: notes [#Trainer]
Ask the participants to take 5 minutes to discuss and come up with some thoughts
Collect responses from participants

## Characteristics of data

What are the core characteristics of data? 

We thought of:

- Has a label: data relates to a concept of inquiry
  - e.g. 16* &rarr; temperature, London &rarr; geography, 14:00 &rarr; time
- Has an identifier: a person or an organiisation has to observe, collect or measure the data
  - e.g. a meteorologist, Met Office
- The data type is consistent within a single inquiry: e.g. all numbers, all text, all symbols
 
---

## Data Definition [#Overview]

Data has different definitions in different contexts and disciplines.

What does Wikipedia tell us?

- "Data is a collection of discrete or continuous *values* that convey *information* describing the *quantity, quality, fact, statistics*, or other basic units of meaning, or sequences of *symbols* that may be further interpreted *formally*"

---

## Data types -- Expand this

- Data can be ...
    - Qualitative / Quantitative 
    - *Should we include nominal, ordinal, scale // discrete and continous?* - not name SATA and SPSS but introduce the concepts here?
    - 
| Data  | Type  | 
|-------|-------|
|       |       |         


   - Numbers e.g. 16*
  - Text e.g. 'Sunny conditions will continue all day.'
  - Symbols e.g. ☀️

## Data in research [#Overview]

Data in research has a specific meaning and purpose:

- 'Data that are used as primary sources to support technical or scientific enquiry, research, scholarship, or  artistic activity, and that are used as evidence in the research process and/or are commonly accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research findings and results.' -- CODATA

## Data as a research object

- Data is a representation of something in the world, that has been captured in a specific way

  ``` mermaid
  
  flowchart LR
    sitw(Something in the world) --> Rec(Which is recorded)
    Rec --> Rep(Has a representation)

- If data is the representation, what could the first two boxes be?

   ``` mermaid

    flowchart LR
      Q1(?) --> Q2(?)
      Q2 --> Rep1(Has a representation)

## Data as a research object [#Overview]

Through this course, we will use the terms: Concept, Measure and Data

  ``` mermaid

  flowchart LR
    C(Concept) --> Me(Measure)
    Me --> Rep(Has a representation)

  ```

<img src="img/concept-measurement-data.png" alt="Alt Text" width="700" height="300">

---

## Weather data 

- Going back to the weather data we look at at the start of the course, fill in the blank research data flow:

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    C(Concept) --> Me(Measure)
    Me --> Rep(Has a representation)

```

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    B1(            ) --> B2(             )
    B2 --> B3(             )

```

<img src="img/c-m-d-blank.png" alt="Alt Text" width="700" height="300">

---

## Weather data 

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    tol(Temperature of London) --> de(Degrees)
    de --> td("-20...45")

```
- You may have got the same or you might have looked at wind gusts or chance of rain. For example:

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    wgl(Wind gusts in London) --> mph(Miles per hour)
    mph --> mphd("0...100")

```

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    cor(Chance of rain in London) --> prc(Percent)
    prc --> prcd("0...100")

```

- Depending on the focus of your research, the Concept, Measure and Data will be different.

## Data as a research object

Here is another example:


``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    aop(Age of person) --> Ye(Years)
    Ye --> yd(0...115)

```

``` mermaid

flowchart BT
    aop(Age of person) --> C(Concept)
    Q(Question) --> Me(Measure)
    V(Variable) --> d(data)
    direction BT
    Qd --> Q
    dp --> V
      subgraph Questionnaire
        Qd(What is your age)
      end
      subgraph Dataset
        dp(Age)
      end
    

```

## Practice [#worksheet]

Congratulations! You’re the newest member of a longitudinal research team at University College London.

The research is funded by UK Department for Young people and the Economic and Social Research Council. The research is looking into the impacts of social media on young people in Onglond.

They have already completed two Waves, collecting data from 437 participants aged 11-16 year olds through questionnaires. WAVE 1 was completed in 2021 and WAVE in 2023. 

You will conduct the next wave of research in two months time. 

---

## Practice (question) [Worksheet]

As part of this research, you will need to find out how long each pariticipant spend on social media  platforms a day.

Fill out the Concept, Measure and Data boxes that might be needed to conduct this inquiry.

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    C(Concept) --> Me(Measure)
    Me --> Rep(Has a representation)

```

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    B1(            ) --> B2(             )
    B2 --> B3(             )

```

---


## Practice (answer) [#Worksheet]

One answer could be:

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    tsosm(Time Spent on Social Media) --> min(Minutes)
    min --> d(0...1440)

```
Before that, you might want to ask *if* they are on social media ...

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    osm(Active on Social Media) --> tf(True/False)
    tf --> d(Y/N)

```

and if so, what social media platforms are they on ...

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    smp(Live accounts
    on social media platforms)
    Q(*What would this be*)
    smp --> Q
    Q --> Q2(*What would this be?*)

```

---

## Application [#Worksheet]

Fill out the Concept, Measure, Data boxes for your dataset.

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    C(Concept) --> Me(Measure)
    Me --> Rep(Has a representation)

```

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    B1(            ) --> B2(             )
    B2 --> B3(             )

```

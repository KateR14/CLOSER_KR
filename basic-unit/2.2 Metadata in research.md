## What does metadata apply to?

- Most obviously, metadata applies to data which has been collected for a specific purpose, through a measurement such as Blood Pressure, a Question in a survey or census, or as part of an administrative process and data captured through a device such as a location
- Less obviously it also applies to data such as text, images or sound which is processed into ‘numbers’ for statistical analysis

## Why create metadata?

- Metadata is the core component of Research Data Management (RDM) and should be included in all Data Management Plans (DMPs)
  
- Metadata may also be required by other organisations such as ...
  - Institutes (in your working contract or project agreements)
  - Funding agencies (ensure reusability and meet FAIR requirements)
  - Journals (as a condition for publishing)
  - Supervisors (data citation to enhance researcher reputation)
  - Projects (collaboration across agencies/organisations)

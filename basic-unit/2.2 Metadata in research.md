## What does metadata apply to?

- Most obviously, metadata applies to data which has been collected for a specific purpose, through a measurement such as Blood Pressure, a Question in a survey or census, or as part of an administrative process and data captured through a device such as a location
- Less obviously it also applies to data such as text, images or sound which is processed into ‘numbers’ for statistical analysis

## Where is metadata found?

Metadata can be found in different places:

- Within a dataset file, for example:
  - Headers
  - Column labels
    
- In a separate file, for example:
  - Documentation provided alongside datasets
    
- On data repositories/archives, for example:
  - As tags in a search return list
  - On a dataset page
  - As filters to search the repository

## Common terms used in metadata [is this needed and if so, where?]

Terms can have different meanings in different context and settings. 
In metadata, we often talk about elements and variables. It is important to define what we mean by these terms in a metadata context.

- Metadata element: 
- Variable:

## Different types of metadata

There are three main types of metadata:

- Structural [definition]
  - [examples]
- Descriptive [definition]
  - [examples]
- Administrative [definition]
  - [examples]

---

## Practice: Identifying different types of metadata

[In the screenshot below, identify which metadata is structural, descriptive or administrative.]

**OR**

[Organise these metadata into structural, descriptive or administrative.]

---

## Answers: Identifying different types of metadata

[Provide answers for the above task.]

## Why create metadata?

Metadata is the core component of Research Data Management (RDM) and should be included in all Data Management Plans (DMPs). 
In the last unit we discussed how metadata improves research efficiency and data quality, making data discoverable, understandable and resuable.

- As metadata is a powerful tool and best practice for research, it may be **required** by other organisations such as ...
  - Institutes (in your working contract or project agreements)
  - Funding agencies (ensure reusability and meet FAIR requirements)
  - Journals (as a condition for publishing)
  - Supervisors (data citation to enhance researcher reputation)
  - Projects (collaboration across agencies/organisations)

## Metadata myths

- Increased workload
- Time consuming and resource heavy
- Limited usability
- Not relevant for your data

[Provide myth busting explanations]

## How is metadata created?

Metadata is created in different ways:

- Automatically generated. For example:
- Metadata software. for example: (This metadata stills needs to be verified by data managers and/or researchers)
- Maunually created, for example:

---

## Who creates metadata?

Data managers
Researchers

Roles in metadata creation
- It is useful to have multiple people working on metadata creation and management so metadata can be quality assured

---

## What metadata do you need to create?

No research is too small for metadata.
The more metadata you create, the more discoverable, accessible and usable your data becomes. 
If you plan 

In our next module, we will explore

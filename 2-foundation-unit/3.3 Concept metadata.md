## Concepts

Concepts
Units of knowledge created by a unique combination of characteristics
We use them to:
- Convey meaning
- Connect similar meanings
- Show differences in meaning

Characteristics enable us to differentiate concepts from one another

Characteristics are semantic groupings of properties
 - For example: Concept = Eye
   - Characteristic: eye color
       - Properities: brown, hazel, green, blue, blue-gray

## Intended Learning Outcome
- Have a firm understadning of what data is and it's purpose in research

## Outline [#trainer]
- What is data?
- Definition of data
- Data in research
- Introduction to example cast study

## What is data?
We use the term data all the time, but what do we actually mean?

---
## Data is everywhere ...

We consume data all the time. Take your weather app for example:

<img src="img/Ldn-apple-weather.jpeg" alt="Alt Text" width="425" height="900">

What data is available when we check the weather?

## Weather data ...

## What makes these data?

- Data can be:
  
  - Numbers e.g. 16*
  - Text e.g. 'Sunny conditions will continue all day. Wind gusts up to 12mph.'
  - Symbols e.g. ☀️

But what are the characteristics of data that differentiates from them being *just* numbers, words and symbols?

## Characteristics of data

We thought of:

- Has a label e.g. column name
- Has an identifier (person or organisation)
- Can be other things like text
- Could have a domension (weight, height, colour)
- Is consistent in the data type used, all numbers, all text

## Data Definition [#Overview]

**Wikipedia**

Data is a collection of discrete or continuous *values* that convey *information* describing the *quantity, quality, fact, statistics*, or other basic units of meaning, or sequences of *symbols* that may be further interpreted *formally*

## Data in research [#Overview]

Data in research has a specific purpose:

- Data that are used as primary sources to support technical or scientific enquiry, research, scholarship, or  artistic activity, and that are used as evidence in the research process and/or are commonly accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research findings and results.

## Data as a research object

- Data is a representation of something in the world, that has been captured in a specific way

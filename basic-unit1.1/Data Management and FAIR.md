## What is data management?

- Discussion

- Data management definition
  - "Research data management (RDM) is about handling research data effectively and appropriately throughout the life of a research project and beyond. Research data management refers to all aspects of creating, storing, sharing and archiving data and is an essential aspect of conducting responsible research" MANTRA

## Bad data management 

What happens if you don't manage your data well ...

[Sam1 Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2zK3sAtr-4)

---

## Bad data management (Discussion)

- Reflecting on the video you've just watched as well as your own experience, what are some examples of bad data management?

- Data is not properly cited or linked in publications
- Links to research are broken 
- Limited information about the data
- Data in unusable or proprietary software
- No information about the data sharing policy or
- Unclear data access process, how long it takes, cost etc.
- Limited context to understand the data

---

## What is the impact of bad data management?

- Again, refelcting on the video and your own experience, what are the impacts of bad data management on research?

- Research data is in a silo
  - Data cannot be re-used by other researchers or by yourself in future studies
  - Research could be unnecessarily duplicated
  - Secondary research or cross-study research cannot happy
- Could jeopardise future research funding
- Data could be less secure
- Time wasted trying to understand data or organise data retrospectively

---

## How to implement good data management 

- Develop a robust Data Management Plan (DMP) at the begining of your research project. A DMP should consider:
  - Conside

- Enact FAIR data principles 
- Create metadata that adheres to relevant standards

---

## Benefits of good data management

- Improves efficiency of your research
- Saves time by establishing robust documentation, stoarge and preservation processes
- Reduces the risk of losing data and enhances lifespan of data
- Required to obtain funding and/or meet funding bodies' requirements
- Enables other researchers to use your research and encourages cross-study research
- Reduces the potential for research duplication
- Improves accuracy and security of your data

## *EXAMPLE NEEDED* - Case study of good data management

- E.g. show a study which has good data documentation / management with a strong DMP
-  Pick a study whose findings have had an impact on policy/industry as well as been the subject of secondary research and/or cross study research

---

## Application: How strong is your data management? [#Worksheet]

- Can you answer the following questions about your research?

## Data Management Tools and Resources [#Overview]

- Develop your knowledge of Data Management using these resources:
  - DataTree: Data Management (Context) and Data Management (Practicalities) modules
  - MANTRA Data Management Training
  - Queen Mary's Research Data Management Training
  - DataOne: Data Management Module
  - Research Data Oxford: Data Management Plans Overview
 
- Assess the quality of data currently:
  - [QAMyData](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/about/research-and-development/past-projects/qamydata/)
    
- Use these tools to help develop a robust Data Management Plan:
  - [DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/): provided by the Digital Curation Centre (DCC), DMPonline facilitates the creation, review, and sharing of data management plans. The online, open resource contains DMP templates and public DMPs for reference.
  - [DMP Tool](https://dmptool.org/plans): this online, open resources contains public DMPs for reference as well as a list of funder requirements to ensure DMPs meet the criteria of the funding body.

## What is FAIR? 

- **F**indable
- **A**ccessible
- **I**nteroperable
- **R**e-usable

## **F**indable

**Findable**: other researchers can easily find your data both by hand and by machine software.

- What you can do:
  - Link your publications/data to your ORCID ID [13]
  - Cite the data that you have used using a DOI
  - Deposit your data in an trusted repository/archive
     - Find an appropriate archive e.g. UKDS or your university
    - **Create rich metadata**
    
---

## **A**ccessible

**Accessible**: other researchers can clearly understand how to access your data. Note, this does not mean data has to be 'open'. Even when data is restricted, rich metadata should be available in order for external researchers to know what your data is descibing and what data sharing policies are in place.

- What you can do:
  - Use standardised technology and available software
  - Provide your data to repositories in their preferred format
  - **Create rich metadata**
---

## **I**nteroperable

**Interoperable**: OVERVIEW

  - What you can do:
      - **Create rich metadata** that adheres to the relevant standards
      - Use existing vocabularies, classifications, ontologies etc. when possibleÂ  
        - e.g. Controlled Vocabularies for mode of collection [11]
        - e.g. Survey responses Office for National statistics ethnic group classification [12]
      
---

## **R**e-usable

**Re-usable**: OVERVIEW

- **Create rich metadata** to provide context 
- use of standardised terms
  
---

## Benefits of FAIR for your data

- Maximises the value and usefulness of your data
- Ensures long-term preservation of your data
- Enables cross-study research
- Speeds up the progress of research
- Improves our confidence in data and research

---

## The importance of FAIR important for research

- Helps demonstrate the impact of research when people re-use and cite your dataset, so you get credit for all your outputs
- Easier for others to find your data and increases your visibility
- Scientific journals and funders now require scientists to share data
- To meet the expectations of researchers in the 21st century
- Improves the quality data and accuracy of your research results
- Provides proof of transparent and valid conduct
- Easier to search, find, assess and access useable, clear, understandable data in a straightforward and timely way

## What was the recurring element that helped implement FAIR Principles?

## What was the recurring element that helped implement FAIR Principles?

Metadata!

- Documenting your data through creating rich metadata is one of the most effective ways of implementing FAIR principles in your research
- In the next module we will delve into exploring metadata including:
  - What is metadata?
  - How to identify what metadata is most important to create for own use and use by others
  - How and when to create metadata
  - Best practice in creating and using metadata

## FAIR Data Assessment List

Using the FAIR Data Assessment list 

- (F) Does you dataset have a persistent identified e.g. a PID or DOI?
- (F) Is your data in a trusted repository?
- (A+R) Does your data have an assigned license and data sharing policy? (please note, your data does not need to be open to be FAIR)
- (F+A) Does your dataset have a README file?
  - Does your README file explain how one could access the data?
  - Does your README file explain the necessary software required to access the file?
- (F+A+I+R) Does your data have metadata that adheres to relevant schemas and standards?

## Summary

- **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, **R**e-usable
- Aims to optimise and make reuse of data easier
- Metadata is key to FAIR
- Metadata should ideally be documented from the start and updated throughout to feed into FAIR processes
- Infrastructures are best placed to implement FAIR for the benefit of users
- Data producers and users need to contribute to create FAIR data

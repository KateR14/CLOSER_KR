## Bad data management (Discussion)

- Reflecting on the video you've just watched as well as your own experience, what are some of the reasons people struggle to access research data?

- Cannot find the data from a publication
- Broken links
- Limited information about the data
- Data in unusable or proprietary software
- Multiple places to look 
- Need to request access before can view the data
- Unclear data access process, how long it takes, cost etc.
- Limited context to understand the data

---

## What is the impact of bad Data Management?

- Research data is in a silo
  - Data is not easily compared
  - Research could be unnecessarily replicated
  - Research cannot be built on by future research

---

## How to implement good Data Management 

- Develop a robust Data Management Plan at the begining of your research project
- Enact FAIR data principles 
- Create metadata that adheres to relevant standards

----

## Data Management Tools and Resources

- Develop your knowledge of Data Management using these resources:
  - DataTree: Data Management (Context) and Data Management (Practicalities) modules
  - MANTRA Data Management Training
  - Queen Mary's Research Data Management Training
  - DataOne: Data Management Module
  - Research Data Oxford: Data Management Plans Overview
    
- Use these tools
  - DMPonline: provided by the Digital Curation Centre (DCC), DMPonline facilitates the creation, review, and sharing of data management plans. The online, open resource contains DMP templates and public DMPs for reference.
  - DMP Tool: this online, open resources contains public DMPs for reference as well as a list of funder requirements to ensure DMPs meet the criteria of the funding body.

## What is FAIR?

---

## What is FAIR? 

- **F**indable
- **A**ccessible
- **I**nteroperable
- **R**e-usable

---

## **F**indable

**Findable**: Meta(data) should be easy to find for both humans and computers 

- meta(data) platforms for easier discovery
- use of persistent identifiers e.g. DOIs

---

## **A**ccessible

**Accessible**: Users need to know how the data can be accessed

- what the access process is

---

## **I**nteroperable

**Interoperable**: Data can be integrated with other data and work with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing

- standardised technology and available software
- computers can understand what the data is

---

## **R**e-usable

**Re-usable**: Meta(data) should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined

- metadata to provide context 
- use of standardised terms
  
---

## Why is FAIR important?

- To meet the expectations of researchers in the 21st century
- Speeds up the progress of research
- Improves our confidence in data and research
- Maximises the value and usefulness of data
- Ensures long-term preservation

---

## Why is FAIR important for you?

- Helps demonstrate the impact of research when people re-use and cite your dataset, so you get credit for all your outputs
- Easier for others to find your data and increases your visibility
- Scientific journals and funders now require scientists to share data 
- Produces quality data and accurate research results
- Provides proof of transparent and valid conduct
- Easier to search, find, assess and access useable, clear, understandable data in a straightforward and timely way

---

## Implementing FAIR

Infrastructures such as archives and metadata platforms are in the ideal position and have the most responsibility in implementing FAIR 
provide:

- Persistent identifiers e.g. DOIs
- Managing and providing vocabularies
- Platforms to hold discoverable, consistent metadata
- Governance arrangements to access data

---

## Implementing FAIR (examples)

- Archives and catalogues which help researchers discover data (e.g. UKDS Data catalogue)
- Rich, comprehensive metadata repositories which help researchers discover, assess and understand data (e.g. CLOSER Discovery)
- You can help infrastructures provide these services by supplying quality metadata 

---

## Your potential responsibilities (1)

- Understand the value of sharing and reusing data and FAIR principles
- Plan your data management and create a Data Management Plan (DMP) [10]
- Think about and document your plans to prevent future data issues e.g. documentation, storage and preservation

---

## Your potential responsibilities (2)

- Document your data using metadata
- What metadata is most important to create for own use and use by others 
- Create and store your metadata from the start, use and update this throughout the process so it’s ready when needed
- Use existing vocabularies, classifications, ontologies etc. when possible  
  - e.g. Controlled Vocabularies for mode of collection [11]
  - e.g. Survey responses Office for National statistics ethnic group classification [12]

---

## Your potential responsibilities (3)

- Deposit your data in an archive
  - If you need to deposit your data, find an appropriate archive e.g. UKDS or your university
  - Provide the data in their preferred format 
  - Seek advice to anticipate what metadata to provide
- Link and cite
  - Link your publications/data to your ORCID ID [13]
  - Cite the data that you have used using a DOI

---

## Summary

- **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, **R**e-usable
- Aims to optimise and make reuse of data easier
- Metadata is key to FAIR
- Metadata should ideally be documented from the start and updated throughout to feed into FAIR processes
- Infrastructures are best placed to implement FAIR for the benefit of users
- Data producers and users need to contribute to create FAIR data

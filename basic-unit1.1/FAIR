## FAIR data principles

An important principle to underpin any data management approach is the FAIR data principles.

---

## What is FAIR?

You might have hear about FAIR before or this might be the first time you're coming across the principles. 

Here is a short video to give an overview of what FAIR data is in research.

## What is FAIR? [#Overview]

- **F**indable
- **A**ccessible
- **I**nteroperable
- **R**e-usable

What can we do as researchers to enact each of these principles?

## **F**indable

**Findable**: other researchers can easily find your data both by hand and by machine software.

- What you can do:
  - Link your publications/data 
    - [How to Cite Datasets and Link to Publications DDC Guide](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/cite-datasets)
  - Cite the data that you have used using a DOI or PID
    - Consider creating an Orchid ID
    - DataCite Scheme
  - Deposit your data in an trusted repository/archive
     - Find an appropriate archive e.g. UKDS or your university
     - [Where to keep research data - DDC guide](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/where-keep-research-data)
    - **Create rich metadata**

## **F**indable practice tasks

**Findable** task 1: Using this tool, find the trusted repository or archive that is best suited for your data.

**Findable** task 2: Using this tool, creat a DOI for your research

## **A**ccessible

**Accessible**: other researchers can clearly understand how to access your data. Note, this does not mean data has to be 'open'. Even when data is restricted, rich metadata should be available in order for external researchers to know what your data is descibing and what data sharing policies are in place.

- What you can do:
  - Use standardised technology and available software
    - EXAMPLE OF STANDARDISED tehcnology
  - Provide your data to repositories in their preferred format
    - EXPLAIN WHERE TO FIND THIS
  - **Create rich metadata**

## **A**ccessible example

**Accessible**:Screenshot of reserach that uses standardised technology, good metadata and

## **I**nteroperable

**Interoperable**: OVERVIEW

  - What you can do:
      - **Create rich metadata** that complies to the relevant metadata standards and schemas 
      - Use existing vocabularies, classifications, ontologies etc. when possible  
        - e.g. Controlled Vocabularies for mode of collection [11]
        - e.g. Survey responses Office for National statistics ethnic group classification [12]

## **R**e-usable

**Re-usable**: OVERVIEW

- **Create rich metadata** to provide context 
- use of standardised terms
  
---

## Benefits of FAIR for your data

- Maximises the value and usefulness of your data (HOW)
- Ensures long-term preservation of your data
- Enables cross-study and secondary research
- Speeds up the progress of research (HOW)
- Improves our confidence in data and research

---

## The importance of FAIR important for research

- Helps demonstrate the impact of research when people re-use and cite your dataset, so you get credit for all your outputs
- Easier for others to find your data and increases your visibility
- Scientific journals and funders now require scientists to share data
- To meet the expectations of researchers in the 21st century
- Improves the quality data and accuracy of your research results
- Provides proof of transparent and valid conduct
- Easier to search, find, assess and access useable, clear, understandable data in a straightforward and timely way

## FAIR Data Assessment List

Using the FAIR Data Assessment list 

- (F) Does you dataset have a persistent identified e.g. a PID or DOI?
- (F) Is your data in a trusted repository?
- (A+R) Does your data have an assigned license and data sharing policy? (please note, your data does not need to be open to be FAIR)
- (F+A) Does your dataset have a README file?
  - Does your README file explain how one could access the data?
  - Does your README file explain the necessary software required to access the file?
- (F+A+I+R) Does your data have metadata that adheres to relevant schemas and standards?

## What was the recurring element that helped implement FAIR Principles?

---

## What was the recurring element that helped implement FAIR Principles?

Metadata!
- Documenting your data through creating rich metadata is one of the most effective ways of implementing FAIR principles in your research
  
- In the next module we will delve into exploring metadata including:
  - What is metadata?
  - How to identify what metadata is most important to create 
  - How and when to create metadata
  - Best practice in creating and using metadata

---

## Summary

- **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, **R**e-usable
- Aims to optimise and make reuse of data easier
- Metadata is key to FAIR
- Metadata should ideally be documented from the start and updated throughout to feed into FAIR processes
- Infrastructures are best placed to implement FAIR for the benefit of users
- Data producers and users need to contribute to create FAIR data
